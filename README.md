## Overview

This is a one-day, hands-on workshop for those who have embraced the tidyverse and want to improve their R programming skills and, especially, reduce the amount of duplication in their code. The two main ways to reduce duplication are creating functions and using iteration. We will use a tidyverse approach to cover function design and iteration with {purrr}.

-   Master the art of writing functions that do one thing well, adhere to existing conventions and can be fluently combined together to solve more complex problems.
-   Learn how to perform the same action on many objects using code which is succinct and easy to read.


**This workshop is for you if you...*

-   have experience equivalent to an introductory data science course using tidyverse
-   feel comfortable with the Whole game chapter of R for Data Science

## Prework

ADD INFORMATION YOU WANT LEARNERS TO HAVE / STEPS THEY WANT THEM TO
COMPLETE PRIOR TO THE WORKSHOP. THIS COULD BE A LINK TO A THREAD ON
RSTUDIO COMMUNITY, PACKAGE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS, HOW TO GET AN
RSTUDIO.CLOUD ACCOUNT, ETC.
